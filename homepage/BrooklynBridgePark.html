    <p class="a">Brooklyn Bridge park, a place that I genuinly enjoyed mostly because of the view atomsphere. It was the evroment filled with loud noises of screaming and shouting in the distance. When I got there, I experienced very cold numbness from my body because it was that cold. Was it worth it? Yes, it was and in fact, the feeling of enjoyment at the park that helped me neglect the feeling of being cold at the place.  THere's people running and jogging along the bayside. Looking over at the horizon, you see tons of seaguls either loitering or wandering around the ports for private owned boats. There ware also some beautifully designed homes right beside the park which made this an amazing place to appreciate just how luxurious this place is. And for the cherry on top, you can't forget about the beautiful night skylines that I anticipated to wait out while I explore the other part of Brooklyn Bridge park. There tons of people lining up to take picture and eventually, when I got the chance, it felt great to get a picture of one of the most beautiful scenery Brooklyn. Despite the place being very cold being that I visited during the winter season, it was still a worthy experience to explore all 7 piers of the park as well as also witnessing the Manahattan night skylines across the the New York bay as you just dream about one day owning a house right near this place of a beautiful view of Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
