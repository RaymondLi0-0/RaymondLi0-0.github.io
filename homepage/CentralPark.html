    <h2 style="font-size:3vw">Review:</h2>
    <p class="a">Central Park, an iconic place where many people would think about when Manhattan comes to mind. It is also one of the known hotspots for tourist attraction available in Manhattan. When I first came into the park, there a lot of children playing in the plaground. As I walk further deeper down the park I saw a lot of hills, big trees, and horse carriages. Not like many parks, what makes entral park so special is because of the place, enviorment, and location. It's not common to visit a park and suddenly see a horse drawn carriage passing by you. Central Park wa a place that, as you get deeper into the place, you would see a lot more suprises. There was gooses lingering around. I even got the chance to experience a goose walk to me even though I had not food with me. Too bad I couldn't pet the animals, but I still enjoyed watching the gooses walking around and swimming, pretty much doing whatever they're doing. There was just so much life in central park despite the cold as there squirrels and birds and not just gooses being present there. You also got people running/jogging and biking on the lanes which provides a good spot for people during the summer or during a good day to excercise or to generally enjoy a good day. THere was also a lot people walking around like I was doing, some taking pictures or generally enjoying their day despite the cold weather. Even though Manahttan is a really big city with tall towers surrounding you like crazy, the place did still provide some sort of a good view to view and take pictures. Overall there is just so much to see at central park and I believe it's up to visitors of the park to visit for themselves and have fun exploring.</p>
